# Application to Deworming Interventions   
.pull-left[
## Policy issue and proposed policy 
- Parasitic worm infections are endemic in many LMICs
- Decrease nutrient uptake and can lead to serious consequences on human health  
- Analyze policy of mass deworming interventions, at school level

## Extrapolating from research 
- Findings come from intervention in Kenya in 1998-99 (Miguel and Kremer 2004, Baird et. al. 2016, Hamory et. al. 2020) 
- Current settings around the world vary in prevalence rates, implementation costs, and length of treatments

## Contributions of OPA to deworming:  
  1. Selected one policy estimate among several alternatives and establish a clear link between it and underlying assumptions 
  2. Added documentation to increase reproducibility 
  3. Created a public repository with all materials for one-click reproducibility

# Barriers to scaling-up: Incentives, incentives, incentives

.font120[
No single agent/stakeholder has incentives to individually increase transparency. 

**Policy Markers:**
 - Better off having a menu of reports.

**Policy Analysts:**
 - Constantly putting down fires, no time to thoroughly improve documentation.
 - Opacity in policy analysis increases the value of reputation. Hence, high credentialed analysts have 
  negative incentives to increase transparency.
 
**Researchers:** 
  - Incentive to generate novel and rigorous findings trumps everything else. 
  - No incentive to increase the rigor of extrapolation exercises ("quick and dirty", "back of the envelope")
  - Widespread contempt from academia to policy analysis.

# Next Steps for OPA

<br>
.font120[
## Deworming OPA v2.0
- Incorporate intergenerational effect on children mortality

## Unemployment Insurance OPA v0.3 (w/BIFYA)
- Review and improve Open Materials component

## Promote transparency in policy analysis
- Find and support policy entrepreneurs for transparency in policy analysis (e.g. Santiago Levy for Impact Evaluations)

# Open Output

.pull-left[
## [Demo](https://bitss-opa.shinyapps.io/dw-app/)

<br>
## Main features
- One clear output  
previously agreed in   
consultation with  
policy partner
- Two additional tabs to modify assumptions  
(key assumptions and all assumptions)
- Each source is classified into research,   
data, or guesswork
- High level equations added to illustrate location of components
- Added feature to modify standard deviations
- Track values of each component

## [Demo](https://bitss-opa.github.io/opa-deworming/)
<br>
## Main features
- Complete narrative description of the methodology
- Translation of each narrative step into an equation
- Implementation of each equation into code
- Combine all of the above into using a dynamic document (RMarkdown)
- Presentation of narrative, equations, and code in layered fashion to avoid overwhelming the reader

# .font90[What If The Policy Analysis Does Not Have Open Output?]
- Two fictitious policy analyses 
- The connection between all assumptions and final output has been hidden
- Both claim to report on the same fact (policy estimate). Code is available, reproducible, and each as an interactive app and dynamic document. 
- Wildly different results by choosing a different policy approach (and not reporting)

# Opaque Output: Example #2

.pull-left[
- Policy estimates of approach 2   
of deworming (Baird et al, 2016)
- Assume Open Analysis and   
Open Materials
- Good for researchers 
- Unclear for policy analysts
- Allows policy makers to  
cherry pick results
- Does not disclose uncertainty
- Unclear separation of roles  
between policy analyst and   
policy maker (Truman's request  
for a "one-handed" economist)

- Two fictitious policy analyses

- Both claim to report on the same fact (policy estimate). Code is available, reproducible, and each as an interactive app.

# Opaque Analysis/Materials
<br>
.font140[
-  Assume open output and open materials  
-  In this scenario we can have two policy analyses: one from advocates and one from opponents
-  Each analysis can claim to be open source. Code is available, reproducible, and each as an interactive app. 
-  But each analysis can bury in their code analytical choices that move the final policy estimate in their favor
-  Same thought exercise can be done with opaque materials
